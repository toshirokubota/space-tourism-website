## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

I followed (up to the home page design) Kevin Powell's development on Scrimba. It was helpful to kick start the project, and to learn how to improve the accessibility, how to organize the design with custom variables, and how to balance between utility classes and component classes in CSS. 

I am not very comfortable with asynchronous programming, especially with promises and async/await. But I could practice more in this project and I am more comfortable with them than before...

I did use export/import of functions, although that was not really necessary. 

### Continued development

I continue on the advanced CSS learning path.
